  Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description

  The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing

  String results;
  int boardBeans;
  int boardGuess;
  int cloudBeans;
  int cloudGuess;
  bool boardBeans_Ready;
  bool boardGuess_Ready;
  bool cloudBeans_confirm;
  bool cloudGuess_confirm;

  Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
  which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
  These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.
